Asgard = AO simple GUI and realtime display =
 AO status display described in ATT Operations (Science) System Document.

Javascript front end (view-zgwd.js for now (started with the DMS demo))
and python back end (abe.py)

abe.py sends row updates to Asgard front end (JavaScript in browser)
via JSON.  For now it's a simple simulation.  Someday it will
monitor AO events (from MongoDB?).
